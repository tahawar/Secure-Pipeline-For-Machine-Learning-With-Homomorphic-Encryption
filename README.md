# Secure-Pipeline-For-Machine-Learning-With-Homomorphic-Encryption

In this modern world of technology, a vast amount of personal data is required to perform
computations. This data can be vulnerable to attack by third-party intruders or malicious
actors. To eliminate this problem, we are using Homomorphic Encryption to develop
a pipeline for securing individual data. Our main aim is to secure the data instead of
the model. Secure Machine Learning includes growing and enforcing device studying
fashions which are proof against assaults and making sure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the statistics and fashions used. The encrypted data goes to the model
which then gets trained on it. The model predicts the result and then performs decryption.
In this system, neither the developer nor the model is aware of the authentic data.
