# Secure-Pipeline-For-Machine-Learning-With-Homomorphic-Encryption

In this modern world of technology, a vast amount of personal data is required to perform computations. This data can be vulnerable to attack by third-party intruders or malicious actors. To eliminate this problem, we are using Homomorphic Encryption to develop a pipeline for securing individual data. Our main aim is to secure the data instead of the model. Secure Machine Learning includes growing and enforcing device studying fashions which are proof against assaults and making sure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the statistics and fashions used. The encrypted data goes to the model which then gets trained on it. The model predicts the result and then performs decryption. In this system, neither the developer nor the model is aware of the authentic data.

# Homomorphic Encryption
Homomorphic encryption is a encryption technique that allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it allowing data to be kept private and secure even while processing. The goal is to enable secure and private computation on sensitive data. There are three main types of homomorphic encryption:

1. Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)
2. Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)
3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

We will be implementing Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) as well as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to conclude best of our results.
