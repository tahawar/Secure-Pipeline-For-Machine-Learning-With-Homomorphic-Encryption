# Secure-Pipeline-For-Machine-Learning-With-Homomorphic-Encryption

Machine learning algorithms often require access to large datasets that may contain personal, financial, or medical information, which can be vulnerable to attacks by hackers,
cybercriminals, or other malicious actors. To overcome this problem we are using Homomorphic encryption. We are developing a pipeline to secure the individuals data, data set
can be generic our aim is to secure the data not the model. Secure machine learning is a
method that enables precise data analysis while preserving the security of individual data
contributors. Secure machine learning involves developing and implementing machine
learning models that are resistant to attacks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the data and models used. User gives the data to model but before going
to model the data will be encrypted and our model will train on encrypted data and when
user insert any query the query again get encrypted the it goes to model. The model predict the result and decrypt it and send it to user. In this process neither the developer nor
the model knows the original data.
